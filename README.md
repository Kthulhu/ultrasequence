ULTRASEQUENCE

An ultra-fast Python file sequencing tool with useful custom features. This
package is exponentially faster than many of the similar packages.

In most cases, with standard naming conventions where the frame number is the
last set of digits in the filename, this tool will be able to build the
sequences with roughly O(n) speeds. Other similar tools are generally O(nÂ²)
or slower.

> IMPORTANT: Currently all symlinks and hardlinks will be ignored completely
as if they do not exist. This is intentional behavior until further testing
is done to get around symlink issues on various platforms.

## Features
* Compatible with the latest versions of Python 2 and 3.
* Ultra-fast O(n) sequencing. Can handle hundreds of thousands of input files 
in a matter of seconds.
* Custom include and exclude extensions so only the file extensions you want 
will be sequenced, otherwise they will immediately move into a skipped list.
* Get file stats on the fly, or supply them in an ordered tuple, dictionary,
or pass an os.stat_result object directly for each file.
* Force file naming with different padding levels to be treated as different
sequences, or allow inconsistent padding.
* Custom string formatting of the sequenced file names.
* Highly customizable - you can even supply your own regex pattern to the
sequencer to change how and where it finds the frame number.

## Platforms
The following Platforms are Tests:
* OSX 10.10

It should run on all recent versions of OSX, and Linux platforms, but further
testing is needed.

## Usage
To use the library in python is very easy. Simply import the ultrasequence
module and then use the Parser object to set up the options. Then you simply
call one of the parser methods of the Parser class depending on the type of
item you are parsing (directoy, file, or python list).

```python
import ultrasequence as us
parser = us.Parser()
parser.parse_directory('~/Documents', recurse=True)
print(parser)
```

This will output how many items are in each sequence:
>Parser(sequences=15, single_frames=75, non_sequences=810, excluded=0, collisions=0)

These lists can be accessed as normal lists such as:
```python
for frame in parser.sequences[0]:
    print(frame)
    
for sequence in parser.sequences:
    print('Sequence %s is missing %s frames' % 
          (sequence.format('%h%P%T'), sequence.missing_frames))
```

To use the command-line utility, run the findseq command after installing
ultrasequence:

```bash
$ findseq /path/to/directory -R --include dpx exr png
```

All command line options can be overridden by installing the local config
file to `~/useq.conf` and updating it with your settings of choice:

```bash
$ findseq -M
```

This file will always be used as default for both python and command-line
usage, which can make some command line options impossible to enable or
disable. If using a local config file, you can temporarily disable it
by using the `-I` flag. All command line flags are then reset to default and
can be overridden by using the flags to change the default behavior.

When using the python code directly, you can pass args into the Parser() init
and the parse_* methods to override this file on the fly.
